+ CODE AHRS pour le SEN_10736 !



SEN-11486
This is example Arduino code that allows you to print raw accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer data. The original library came from i2cdevlib.com and was based on the very similar MPU-6050, which only used an accelerometer and gyro. The MPU-6050 device library was modified to include raw magnetometer data for the MPU-9150.
